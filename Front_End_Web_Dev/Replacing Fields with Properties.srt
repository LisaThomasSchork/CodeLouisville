00:00:09,506 --> 00:00:12,892
Hi, there this is James,
in this C# practice session,

3
00:00:12,892 --> 00:00:16,287
you'll practice creating and
using properties in C#.

4
00:00:16,287 --> 00:00:22,168
It reinforces what you learned in
stage 5 of the C# objects course.

5
00:00:22,168 --> 00:00:24,831
If you find this practice session
too challenging to complete,

6
00:00:24,831 --> 00:00:26,421
you might need to review that course.

7
00:00:26,421 --> 00:00:29,855
See the teacher's notes for a link.

8
00:00:29,855 --> 00:00:34,657
This practice session is the fifth in a
series of sessions where you'll build out

9
00:00:34,657 --> 00:00:36,999
a media library console application.

10
00:00:36,999 --> 00:00:40,460
Step by step,
you'll add features to the program.

11
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:44,502
Eventually you'll be able
to use C# to add, list, and

12
00:00:44,502 --> 00:00:48,286
search for items like albums,
books, and movies,

13
00:00:48,286 --> 00:00:52,597
whatever you want to have
cataloged in your media library.

14
00:00:52,597 --> 00:00:56,752
In the previous practice sessions
we created a class hierarchy for

15
00:00:56,752 --> 00:00:58,681
our program's media types and

16
00:00:58,681 --> 00:01:03,150
we used encapsulation and arrays to
improve the design of our program.

17
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:08,418
In this practice session we'll see how we
can replace class fields with properties.

18
00:01:08,418 --> 00:01:12,842
And use computer properties
to add atributes whose values

19
00:01:12,842 --> 00:01:15,374
are based upon other atributes.

20
00:01:15,374 --> 00:01:20,087
Go ahead and open your work space from
the previous practice session, or

21
00:01:20,087 --> 00:01:24,119
you can open the work space that
I´ve attached to this video.

22
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:28,361
If you want,
you can download the project files in

23
00:01:28,361 --> 00:01:33,314
order to use an external editor or
IDE like Visual Studio.

24
00:01:33,314 --> 00:01:37,147
Before we go about replacing
our class fields to properties,

25
00:01:37,147 --> 00:01:39,737
let's reveal what we'd want to do this?

26
00:01:39,737 --> 00:01:45,138
In the C# objects course,
three reasons were discussed.

27
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:49,911
First, properties have getters and
setters which gives us a way to

28
00:01:49,911 --> 00:01:55,040
associate code with the get in and
or setting of the property's value.

29
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,398
Second, properties make
debugging easier as you can set

30
00:01:59,398 --> 00:02:02,222
break points in gitters or setters.

31
00:02:02,222 --> 00:02:06,945
And third, properties help future proof
our code by encapsulating our fields.

32
00:02:06,945 --> 00:02:11,991
This gives us a way to change
the underlying implementation of

33
00:02:11,991 --> 00:02:16,947
our class without changing how
consumers interact with it.

34
00:02:16,947 --> 00:02:21,479
Our media library program contains
four media type related classes.

35
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:26,118
A Media Type base class, and

36
00:02:26,118 --> 00:02:32,498
three Media Type subclasses—album,

37
00:02:32,498 --> 00:02:35,598
book, and movie.

38
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:46,995
For your first challenge,
replace each public field with a property,

39
00:02:46,995 --> 00:02:51,311
in the MediaType base class, and
Album, Book, and Movie subclasses.

40
00:02:51,311 --> 00:02:54,993
Use either the regular C# property syntax,
or

41
00:02:54,993 --> 00:02:59,329
the more concise auto-implemented
property syntax.

42
00:02:59,329 --> 00:03:03,325
Also use private setters for
fields that should be read-only and

43
00:03:03,325 --> 00:03:06,530
initialize those properties
via the constructor.

44
00:03:07,608 --> 00:03:11,671
And, in the media type base class,
initialize the loanee and

45
00:03:11,671 --> 00:03:16,532
onloan properties and line to an empty
string and false, respectively.

46
00:03:16,532 --> 00:03:19,108
And that's your first challenge.

47
00:03:19,108 --> 00:03:21,546
Good luck, and
we'll see you in the next video,

48
00:03:21,546 --> 00:03:23,522
where I'll walk through my solution.
